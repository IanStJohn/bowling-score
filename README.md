# bowling-score
Simple python script to sum a game of 10 pin bowling.

## bowlingScore.py
This is the main file to calculate the score and it contains the public function `bowlingScore(input)` which is used to take an inputted string representing rolls and output the correct score as an integer.

## testing.py
This file is primarly used to quickly generate different possible games of bowling and test them against the `bowlingScore()` function. The calculations still have to be done by hand to verify validity, however it saves time by making random rolls.
